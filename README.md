## Configuration

### Model Configuration
- The system uses a pre-trained YOLO model (`best.pt`)
- Confidence threshold: 0.3 (adjustable in `app.py`)
- Supported classes:
  ```python
  CLASSES = {
      0: 'Hardhat', 1: 'Mask', 2: 'NO-Hardhat', 3: 'NO-Mask',
      4: 'NO-Safety Vest', 5: 'Person', 6: 'Safety Cone',
      7: 'Safety Vest', 8: 'machinery', 9: 'vehicle'
  }
  ```

### Audio Configuration
- Text-to-speech engine: `pyttsx3`
- Audio alerts can be enabled/disabled per request
- Threaded audio playback to prevent blocking

### File Upload Configuration
- Maximum file size: 16MB
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF
- Automatic file cleanup and organization
- Files saved to `uploads/` directory
- Results saved to `results/` directory

## Customization

### Adding New PPE Classes
1. Update the `CLASSES` dictionary in `app.py`
2. Retrain your YOLO model with new classes
3. Update safety violation logic if needed

### Modifying Detection Threshold
Change the confidence threshold in the `detect_objects` function:
```python
filtered_detections = detection.boxes[detection.boxes.conf >= 0.3]  # Adjust threshold
```

### Customizing Safety Messages
Modify the `generate_safety_message` function to customize violation messages.

### UI Customization
- **Colors**: Edit CSS variables in `static/style.css`
  ```css
  :root {
      --primary-color: #6366f1;
      --secondary-color: #8b5cf6;
      --success-color: #10b981;
      --danger-color: #ef4444;
  }
  ```
- **Animations**: Modify `@keyframes` in `static/style.css`
- **Layout**: Adjust Bootstrap grid classes in HTML templates
- **Particles**: Configure in `index.html` particlesJS settings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Camera not working**:
   - Ensure camera permissions are granted in browser
   - Check if camera is being used by another application
   - Try refreshing the browser (F5 or Ctrl+F5)
   - Verify camera is properly connected

2. **Model not loading**:
   - Verify `best.pt` file exists in the root directory
   - Check YOLO model compatibility with Ultralytics version
   - Ensure sufficient memory available (model requires ~100MB)

3. **Audio not working**:
   - Check system audio settings
   - Verify `pyttsx3` installation: `pip install pyttsx3`
   - Try disabling audio alerts as fallback
   - Check browser permissions for audio

4. **Upload failures**:
   - Check file format (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF only)
   - Verify file size is under 16MB
   - Ensure sufficient disk space
   - Check upload permissions for `uploads/` directory

5. **Particles not showing**:
   - Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
   - Ensure JavaScript is enabled
   - Check browser console for errors (F12)
   - Verify particles.js is loading

6. **Animations not smooth**:
   - Close other resource-heavy browser tabs
   - Update graphics drivers
   - Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)
   - Disable hardware acceleration if issues persist

### Performance Optimization

1. **For faster inference**:
   - Use smaller YOLO models (yolov8n vs yolov8s)
   - Reduce image resolution before upload
   - Adjust detection frequency for live feed (currently 3 seconds)
   - Increase confidence threshold to reduce false positives

2. **For better accuracy**:
   - Use higher confidence thresholds (0.5-0.7)
   - Improve lighting conditions
   - Ensure clear, unobstructed views of PPE
   - Use higher resolution images (1920x1080 recommended)

## Development
